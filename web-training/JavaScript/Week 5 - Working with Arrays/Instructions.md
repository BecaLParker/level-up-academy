Ex1: 

Take a look in a browser at Ex1/Ex1_target.html and observe its behaviour
Reproduce this behaviour in Ex1/Ex1.html using JavaScript to:
* Create elements in the table that are:
	* Sorted based on the sort select option
	* filtered based on the class select option

The data values are already available for you.


Ex2:
'Alex'
* splice
* slice

Ex3:
'Alex'
* from
* reduce/reduceRight
* join - a refresher (you might've encountered this while finding palindromes in week 1!)

Ex4:
* find
* includes = what you know as 'contains'
