# brainstorming

Ex1: 

Take a look in a browser at [Ex1/](https://github.com/red-gate/level-up-academy/tree/master/web-training/JavaScript/Week%205%20-%20Working%20with%20Arrays/Ex1)Ex1_target.html and observe its behaviour
Reproduce this behaviour in [Ex1/](https://github.com/red-gate/level-up-academy/tree/master/web-training/JavaScript/Week%205%20-%20Working%20with%20Arrays/Ex1)Ex1.html using JavaScript to:
* Create elements in the table that are:
	* Sorted based on the sort select option
	* filtered based on the class select option

The data values are already available for you.


Ex2:
'Alex'
* splice
* slice

Ex3:
'Alex'
* from
* reduce/reduceRight
* join - a refresher (you might've encountered this while finding palindromes in week 1!)

Ex4:
We've already worked with `filter` which returns the matching elements in an array. Find works similarly, but returns the first match or `undefined`.
* `find` and friends!
* Pop over to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find
* Extract the lambda into its own const
* Beyond `find`, add calls to `findIndex`, `indexOf` and `includes`
* 
* Change the lambda on line 3 to ask for an element of value 42. Run and see what happens.
* Change the lambda on line 3 to ask for an element of value "8", using double-equals.
* Replace all the numbers in `array1` to literals with all of the given names and favourite colours of the colleagues in your breakout room
* Change the lambda to find elements with one of the given names.
* Add a favourite food field to one of the object literals in the array
* Update the lambda to find that one entry
* includes = what you know as 'contains'
