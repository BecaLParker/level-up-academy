# Focus

This week, we are focusing on **functions**, **objects** and **constructors**.

# Task

For these exercises we are goning to use JS Fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/). It's a simple web environment for writing JavaScript snippets.
For now we are going to utilize only the two bottom panes: **JavaScript** and **Result**.

Mobbing: We will take turns driving (sharing our screen) during approx 5 minutes; work and discuss together.

Feel free to access the learning resources during the exercises!

## Exercise 1: Define a function

We'll start off with re-using the [effort we made in week 1](https://github.com/red-gate/level-up-academy/blob/master/web-training/JavaScript/Week%201%20-%20Basic%20Syntax/Instructions.md#exercise-1).

1. Grab (and rewrite if needed) the code from the exercise above
2. Wrap the code it in a function called *greetAndRepeat* that accepts the two parameters *name* and *n*.
3. Write code to call the function.


## Exercise 2: Make it safe

Validate arguments; null values; check that n is numeric

Create a number of failed executions (like a very lightweight unit test); get rid of the console errors


## Exercise 3: Repair this

Introduce global scope

Given function with invalid scoping, generating the wrong result


## Exercise 4: Objects

Object literals; how to use them
Hash table notation vs. dot notation

Difference between null and undefined


## Exercise 5: Constructors

typeof(constructor function)
  vs
typeof(object instance)
  vs
typeof(object literal)


## Exercise 6: Spread and Object.assign
