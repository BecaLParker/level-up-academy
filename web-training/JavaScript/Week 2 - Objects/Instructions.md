# Focus

This week, we are focusing on **functions**, **objects** and **constructors**.

# Task

For these exercises we are goning to use JS Fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/). It's a simple web environment for writing JavaScript snippets.
For now we are going to utilize only the two bottom panes: **JavaScript** and **Result**.

Mobbing: We will take turns driving (sharing our screen) during approx 5 minutes; work and discuss together.

Feel free to access the learning resources during the exercises!

## Exercise 1: Define a function

We'll start off with re-using the [effort we made in week 1](https://github.com/red-gate/level-up-academy/blob/master/web-training/JavaScript/Week%201%20-%20Basic%20Syntax/Instructions.md#exercise-1).

1. Grab (and rewrite if needed) the code from the exercise above
2. Wrap the code it in a function called *greetAndRepeat* that accepts the two parameters *name* and *n*.
3. Write code to call the function.


## Exercise 2: Make it safe

Validate arguments; null values; check that n is numeric

Create a number of failed executions (like a very lightweight unit test); get rid of the console errors


## Exercise 3: Repair this

The following example is expected to calculate a [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of n:

* Run the code with differenct values of n and observe the results
* Analyze why the result is incorrect
* Fix the function
* Analyze and fix the remaining warnings
* What does it tell you about scoping in JavaScript?

## Exercise 4: Objects

https://jsfiddle.net/x08crk6g/
* Can you think of reasons to use each form of accessing an object (lines 6 + 7)?
* Create a second object b with its own name and score
* Create a function that when passed two objects with names and scores, outputs to the console the object name with the highest score
* Create an undefined variable c
* Create a null variable d
* What is the difference between these and how do they compare (*==* and *===*)?


## Exercise 5: Constructors

https://jsfiddle.net/tw7ud10r/1/
* What does this tell you about how objects work in JavaScript?


## Exercise 6: Spread and Object.assign

https://jsfiddle.net/msarwt39/4/
* What does this code do?
* Rewrite the code using the spread syntax (...)
* What can be an alternative to Object.assign or spread syntax?
* In which scenarios Object.assign or spread can be useful?
