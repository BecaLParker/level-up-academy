# Task

For these exercises we are goning to use JS Fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/). It's a simple web environment for writing JavaScript snippets.
For now we are going to utilize only the two bottom panes: **JavaScript** and **Result**.

## Exercise 1

https://jsfiddle.net/ydm8fh95/
1. Run the code
2. The result is written to the *console log*. To see it, click on the **Console** bar at the bottom of the **Result** pane.
3. Introduce a variable with a string value (*name*) and another variable with a numeric value (*n*).
4. Change the code to output "Hello {*name*}!" *n* times.

## Exercise 2

https://jsfiddle.net/ydm8fh95/3/
1. Run the code 
2. Note how the first console output concatenates two *strings* although they are clearly numbers whereas the second output corerces to floating point numbers.
3. Use control flow operators (**if**, **switch** ... ) so that the calculation supports the 4 basic arithmetic operations (passed using the *op* variable) on *a* and *b*.

## Exercise 3: Open discussion
- Variables in JavaScript can be defined using **var**, **let** and **const** keywords. What would be a good guideline for chosing which keyword in your opinion?
- Values in JavaScript can be compared for equlity using **==** and **===** operators. What would be a good guideline for choosing an appropriate operator in your opinion?

# Bonus exercises (if time permits and/or you really get into it)
- Check if a string is a [palindrome](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/palindrome). (Reference for string methods: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp)
- Calculate **n**-th number of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html#:~:text=It%20is%20that%20simple!,out%20the%20next%20few%20numbers%3F)
