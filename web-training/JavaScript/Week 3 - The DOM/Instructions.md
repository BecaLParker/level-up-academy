# Focus

This week, we are focusing on the **Document Object Model** and how JavaScript interacts with it

# Task

For these exercises we will implement common CSS selectors in Javascript!

## Ex1 Adding style
* [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/uy95p2nb/1/)
* In this fiddle is the javascript code to implement the following CSS:
```CSS
li {color: "red";}
```
* Please implement the following CSS:
  
  *
  ```CSS
  li:nth-child(2n) {color: "green"}
  ```
  *
  ```CSS
  div.blue p {color: "blue"}
  ```

## Ex2 Adding classes
* [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/uy95p2nb/2/)
* In this fiddle, please add the blue class to each li inside the ul with id "should_be_blue"

## Ex3 Adding elements
* [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/uy95p2nb/3/)
* Inlining line 7 causes the program to hang - can you explain why?
* Change the doubling function to instead add the nodes with the item they are duplicating so the resulting list is [Item 1, Item 1, Item 2 ...]


## Ex4 Bring it home
* Extract what you've learned and create a local .html page with the above HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Open the web page in your browser
