# Tasks

The task is to use honeycomb to build the Erewhon shop shop. An example shop is shown in target - you should recreate this
The pages provided contain enough code to import honeycomb correctly.

A big part of using libraries like honeycomb is reading and using their documentation. As such, only a single resource has been provided to the honeycomb homepage - the rest is up to you!
## Ex1
In each page for your shop - create the header and nav bar using honeycomb

## Ex2
Create the articles in yours/index.html.

## Ex3
Create the contact form in contact.html

## Ex4
### A
Create the cards in about.html - Can you identify from the documentation the components used without inspecting the html?
### B
Create the table

## Hints
Lots of the shop can be lifted from Week 8 exercise 4 (That's what we did!)
