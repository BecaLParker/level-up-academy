# Tasks
## Exercise 1

### Part A
Open ex1.html in a browser and resize it, observing how the three boxes behave and how the page header text changes.
Editing ex1_yours.html and ex1_yours.css, replicate this behaviour.


### Part B
Take a look at the print preview for ex1_yours.html and ex1.html
Using media queries - configure the printed page to have the title "Media queries printed" and force
the boxes to go left to right instead of top to bottom. 

## Exercise 2
Open ex2.html in a browser and resize it, observing how the shop changes layout when wider.
ex2_yours.html and ex2_yours.css contain the same website optimised for small screen widths only.
Edit ex2_yours.html and ex2_yours.css to replicate our provided behaviour or create your own style for wider screens.

### hint
We only changed the CSS - but you can change the HTML if you wish to
