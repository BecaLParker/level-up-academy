# Tasks
## Exercise 1
* Take a look at target.html in a browser only and edit yours.html/yours.css to get the site looking the same

## Exercise 2
* As a stretch - what else can you do beyond target.html using these techniques?

## Hints
* We have removed some of the HTML as well as all of the CSS from target.html to create yours.html
* You may not need to use everything we have linked to in the resources, you may want to make choices
