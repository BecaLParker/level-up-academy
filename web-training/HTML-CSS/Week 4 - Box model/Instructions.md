# Tasks
## Exercise 1
* Open ex1.html in both a browser and text editor
* Open ex1.css in a text editor
* Understand why the two boxes are different sizes on screen

## Exercise 2
### Part a
* Look at the code for ex2.html and ex2.css
* How do you think the two boxes will look?
* Were you right?

### Part b
* look at the CSS for the longhand and shorthand classes in ex2.css
* [Explanation](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border_shorthand.asp)

### part c
* Don't look at answers/ex2c_answer.css unless you have to. Equally don't inspect the element in a browser to obtain
the css
* Try to create a border that is:
  * green
  * made of dots on the top, left, and right side
  * solid on the bottom
  * has rounded corners of 15px at the top
  * has square corners at the bottom


## Exercise 3
Try to reproduce the navigation bar layout css without inspecting the elements or looking in answers/ex3.css

Specifically create a navigation bar with:
* A green solid border
* Curved cap-ends
* Centered text
* Highlights pink when hovered over a link (You can see this on the target)
* Has no internal borders
* Is not specific to the number of links in the nav bar (Same css for 3 and 4 link bars)
