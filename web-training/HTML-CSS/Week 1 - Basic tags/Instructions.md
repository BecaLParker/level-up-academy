# Task
 Try to recreate the layout in the example file without looking at the html inside (Open it in a browser)
 You can use your own images
 
# Hints
Use specific tags such as `<nav>` and `<header>` as much as possible. 
Make the HTML read in a way that it is clear what everything does without needing to render the document

# Additional
Use a screen reader such as the Windows 10 Narrator to view your page. How does it sound? Do they understand what the pictures
are showing?
