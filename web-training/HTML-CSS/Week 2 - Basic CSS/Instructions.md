# Task
Try to recreate some of the styling shown in the example file (Without looking at the html or css).
Then see what else you can achieve. You should aim to keep your CSS in an external file, though you might need to use some inline css because the course hasn't covered advanced selection techniques yet.

#  Hints
The use of specific tags such as `<nav>` should make it easy to style them differently to other `<ul>` on the page
Don't go too far - future weeks will cover exciting topics such as borders, positioning, and sizing

# Additional
Can you improve the accessibility by using CSS to hide elements that you only want a screen reader to read?
