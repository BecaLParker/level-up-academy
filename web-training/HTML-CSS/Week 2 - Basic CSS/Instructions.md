# Task
Try to recreate some of the styling shown in the example file (Without looking at the html or css).
Then see what else you can achieve

#  Hints
The use of specific tags such as `<nav>` should make it easy to style them differently to other `<ul>` on the page
Don't go too far - future weeks will cover exciting topics such as borders, positioning, and sizing

# Additional
Can you improve the accesability by using CSS to hide elements that you only want a screen reader to read?
