# Task
There are 2 tasks this week.

Task 1, can you debug using brokenTarget.css and brokenTarget.html. This means looking at both files (source code) and fixing them!!

- Why is the navigation list in brokenTarget.html not styled as it is described within brokenTarget.css  
-  Why is only part of the address shown in the footer?  
-  Why does the text "image of shoezone shop" appear to the right of the image?  
-  Why is "welcome to ..." message orange?  


Task 2, can you use CSS and HTML tags to style target.html (no peaking at target.css file!!)?  This includes

-  Making sure the active a tag is styled different to the other links in list at the top of the page.   
-  When you hover over a link with a mouse, it is obvious to the user (remember, no use for touch screen)  
-  The title has a background image! Check it out if you scroll up and down! Consider the background property! It also has a gradient  
-  You can see 3 words are bold in the sentence "Erehwon is the leading UK shop shop, supplying shops to shop-keepers without shops since 2019." Can you make each word bold in 3 different ways?  
-  Notice the text in green and light grey? See that not only do they have a background colour, they also have had their fonts styled.   
-  The 4 rows (with the pictures) have alternating colours. And notice what happens if you hover your mouse over one of them  
-  Font style fun on "satisfied customers"  
-  The address has been styled
