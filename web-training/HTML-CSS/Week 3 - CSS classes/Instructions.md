# Task
There are 2 tasks this week.

Task 1, can you debug using brokenTarget.css and brokenTarget.html. This means looking at both files (source code) and fixing them!!

a. Why is the navigation list in brokenTarget.html not styled as it is described within brokenTarget.css  
b. Why is only part of the address shown in the footer?  
c. Why does the text "image of shoezone shop" appear to the right of the image?  
d. Why is "welcome to ..." message orange?  


Task 2, can you use CSS and HTML tags to style target.html (no peaking at target.css file!!)?  This includes

a. Making sure the active a tag is styled different to the other links in list at the top of the page.   
b. When you hover over a link with a mouse, it is obvious to the user (remember, no use for touch screen)  
c. The title has a background image! Check it out if you scroll up and down! Consider the background property! It also has a gradient  
d. You can see 3 words are bold in the sentence "Erehwon is the leading UK shop shop, supplying shops to shop-keepers without shops since 2019." Can you make each word bold in 3 different ways?  
e. Notice the text in green and light grey? See that not only do they have a background colour, they also have had their fonts styled.   
f. The 4 rows (with the pictures) have alternating colours. And notice what happens if you hover your mouse over one of them  
g. Font style fun on "satisfied customers"  
h. The address has been styled
