Introduction and basic typing.
Start with (JSFiddle?) and possibly show locally with ts file and use compiler on command line. 

# Brain Storming 15/04

- Common issues that TS fixes
- Replace JSFiddle and instead work locally?
- Hello world in TypeScript and see what the resulting JavaScript would look like
- eslint?
- tweak [JavaScript week 1 exercises](https://github.com/red-gate/level-up-academy/blob/master/web-training/JavaScript/Week%201%20-%20Basic%20Syntax/Instructions.md) to incorporate typescript
- Point out enabling strict by default
> The --strict flag in the CLI, or "strict": true in a tsconfig.json toggles them all on simultaneously
- Given an example with a misspelled DOM event handler, "can you spot a bug in this code?"; we can have the computer do it for us


# Tasks
- Piers: Convert W1 JS to TS
- Alex: Come up with example of errors that can be detected via static analysis
- Mark: missspelled DOM event handler example
- Sami: Installing, running and getting feedback from typescript when developing locally
