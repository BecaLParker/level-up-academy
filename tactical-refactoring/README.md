# Tactical refactoring

Taken from the [Large Scale Refactoring Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/sqlclone3118/m/sqlclone3118/1607695975998/3457612ff8b529d112da9eeaa13171e67d0639a9), we have a collection of post-its that have been grouped under the heading of "tactical refactorings". However, they're all short descriptions of a solution to a currently undefined problem and need to be fleshed out before we can decide how (or if) to build course content around them.
