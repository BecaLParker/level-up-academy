# Getting to ~~love~~ get along with Pester 5

This course will give you a crash course into Pester 5, introducing PowerShell concepts as we stumble upon them.

We'll be working with Visual Studio Code unless otherwise specified.

## What is Pester?

>
> Pester provides a framework for writing and running tests. Pester is most commonly used for writing unit and integration tests, but it is not limited to just that. It is also a base for tools that validate whole environments, computer deployments, database configurations and so on.
